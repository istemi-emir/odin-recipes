        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. </p>
        <p>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        </ol>
