        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Chicken Wrap recipe is such an easy weeknight dinner. </p>
        <p>Done in about 25 minutes and delicious, these will become a regular meal in your house. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cooked Chicken</li>
            <li>Romaine Lettuce</li>
            <li>Roma Tomatoes</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Cover the chicken breast completely with water and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 4 to 10 minutes. The thickness of the breasts will determine how long you need to cook it.</li>
            <li>Cook until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees.
                I love cooking mine with an instant read thermometer in it. The one linked has a long cord so it can stay in the whole time it is cooking and alert you when the chicken is done.</li>
        </ol>
